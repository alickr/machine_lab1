# Machine Learning Lab 1

This lab is aimed to walk you through the complete workflow of a machine learning project; from data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and model evaluation/comparison. 

You will work with your machine project teamates for this lab and your team needs to decide whether to use either R or Python as the main programming language. **Each team memeber needs to work on his/her own submission.**

We will use Github for team collaboration and it can be broken down into following steps:

1. The team leader creates a public Github repository under his/her account first.

2. All the other team members fork the repo so you will have a COPY of the repo under your account

3. Git clone YOUR OWN repo otherwise you won't be able to push later.

4. Create a subfolder under your name and finish your code. Push the changes to Github. *Note*: you might want to put csv file and system file in the gitignore.

5. Go to the Github page of YOUR OWN repository and click the "Pull Request" tab. You can find the details [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

6. Submit the pull request so you can see it under team leader's repository.

7. Pair review each other's code before merging it to the master branch.
